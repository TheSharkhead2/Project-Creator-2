# Project Creator 2 (pjcr)

This project aims to provide a simple command line tool that jumpstarts any project you have by creating all of the necessary template files. If you have the same template you use for every Python project, or you would just like to have a consistent template, this tool aims to make this easy for you! I made a really basic version of this tool a little while ago (you can find that [here](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/Project_Creator)), though it had a lot of issues so I decided to start fresh.

## Usage 

TODO 

## Installation 

idk about that yet 

## Roadmap 
- Custom project support (adding new templates for individual users/systems)
- Local file (included in binary) support for default templates
